# John Cena Piezo Buzzer Arduino Sketch

This sketch loops and roughly plays the john cena theme. Currently it is a bare bones program. Later I plan to restructure the code so it is more obvious what notes are being played, and their timings.

The timings could be touched up, but the note frequencies are generally right.

The circuit to run this sketch on is the following:

Arduino Pin 12 - > Piezo Buzzer - > (OPTIONAL) Resistor - > Arduino Ground Pin
